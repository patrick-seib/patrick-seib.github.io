This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to process and clean data, and Tableau to visualize that data afterwards. I used a Random Forest classifier model to fill in unidentified area names, using their lattitude and longitudinal values. I also identified and removed outliers from the data. After it was cleaned and ready for processing, I used Tableau for data visualization.
