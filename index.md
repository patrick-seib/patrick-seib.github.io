### Personal Projects

[Ontario House Prices](https://github.com/patrick-seib/ontario-house-prices)
<img src="images/Overview.png?raw=true"/>
This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to process and clean data, and Tableau to visualize that data afterwards. I used a Random Forest classifier model to fill in unidentified area names, using their lattitude and longitudinal values. I also identified and removed outliers from the data. After it was cleaned and ready for processing, I used Tableau for data visualization.

This project forecasts total retail sales data in Canada. In the project, I used Python and Eviews. I went through multiple iterations of the project before handing in a simple AR(1) model with a trend component. Because the model type was limited to ARMAX due to the assignment constraints, I used macro-economic trend analysis from my personal life to evaluate a one-step-ahead forecast. For this project, I won an in-class competition for the most accurate forecast out of all other students' forecasts.

[Relationship Between News and Asset Prices](https://github.com/patrick-seib/econ-416/blob/master/Relationship_Between_News_and_Asset_Prices.ipynb)
<img src="images/forecastvsjobchange.png?raw=true"/>
This project used Python to evaluate the effect of news releases (employment data from the American Government) and the effect of Wall Street Journal forecasts on asset prices. Specifically, S&P500 prices and 3-month, 1-year, and 10-year government bonds were evaluted to see if the release of news or forecasts had any effect of the valuation of that security. I also checked to see if there was any effect on assets in the time surrounding that news release, either the days leading up to or the days after.
